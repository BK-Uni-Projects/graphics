<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>The coursework assignment is be based around developing an interactive 3D scenario
<ul>
<li>this year, a 3D scene fly through</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The assignment aims to assess practical capability in writing programs that:</li>
<li>generate 3D graphics</li>
<li>update the 3D scene based on human input (i.e. interactive 3D graphics)</li>
<li>The specific assignment and its requirements are detailed below</li>
<li>the marking scheme is separately in the Criterion Reference Grid</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="graphics-features---summary" class="slide level2">
<h1>Graphics Features - summary</h1>
<p>The assignment will use the modern programmable graphics pipeline (e.g. OpenGL 3.1+) and will require a set of basic 3D graphics features, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D geometry</li>
<li>3D (perspective) projections</li>
<li>moving/rotating objects</li>
<li>moving/rotating view points</li>
<li>coloured objects, along with a set of advanced features, such as lighting simulation</li>
<li>texturing</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="specification" class="slide level2">
<h1>Specification</h1>
<ul>
<li>You should implement a simple 3D scene fly-through</li>
<li>The specific geometry (shapes) that you use are not defined - they are up to you</li>
<li>Your scene should contain the following
<ul>
<li>some kind of terrain/land - e.g. fields, mountains</li>
<li>some kind of 2D content in the scene
<ul>
<li>e.g. some triangles</li>
</ul></li>
<li>some kind of 3D vehicle that can be moved by the user
<ul>
<li>e.g. car, helicopter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>other 3D objects of your choice to fulfil the CRG</li>
<li>other features to fulfil the CRG</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note that 3D objects are <strong>solid</strong> 3D objects (e.g. cube)
<ul>
<li>not just triangle in 3-space</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="documentation" class="slide level2">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<ul>
<li>summary document of features implemented</li>
<li>reflection on the development process</li>
<li>at least one screenshot of your assignment running</li>
<li>see CRG</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="languages-toolkit-what-you-can-use" class="slide level2">
<h1>Languages / Toolkit (what you can use)</h1>
<ul>
<li>You can use any programming language that your choose
<ul>
<li>the in-class content has all been C++, but you don't have to follow this</li>
<li>BUT, if not using C++ you will need to support yourself significantly more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You <strong>MUST</strong> makes the call into OpenGL yourself</li>
<li>You <strong>CAN</strong> use appropriate support libraries (but can use alternates if you choose), such as:
<ul>
<li>SDL2</li>
<li>GLEW</li>
<li>GLM</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If in doubt - <strong>ASK</strong>
<ul>
<li>fundamentally, you should be writing the code that makes OpenGL calls, such as <code>glCreateShader()</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="languages-toolkit-what-you-cannot-use" class="slide level2">
<h1>Languages / Toolkit (what you cannot use)</h1>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> use a graphics engine (e.g. Ogre3D, Irrlicht, Three.js)</li>
<li>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> use a games engine (e.g. Unity)</li>
<li>If using C++, you <strong>CANNOT</strong> use an existing object-oriented wrapper (e.g. oglplus)
<ul>
<li>but you can write and use your own if you like ...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If in doubt - <strong>ASK</strong>

</section><section id="submission" class="slide level2">
<h1>Submission</h1>
<ul>
<li>Submit to Blackboard</li>
<li>A single <strong>.zip</strong> file containing:
<ul>
<li>all your C++ source code</li>
<li>all your shader source code (if not in your C++ source)</li>
<li>files sufficient to create a working build environment (e.g. premake files, or just visual studio files)</li>
<li>all your assets (textures)</li>
<li>a compiled, running executable (it doesn't need to be able to run outside the IDE)</li>
<li>your documentation, as PDF</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="demo" class="slide level2">
<h1>Demo</h1>
<ul>
<li>The assignment will be assessed through <strong>in-class demonstration</strong></li>
<li>This will take place in the <strong>first workshop session following the submission deadline</strong></li>
<li>Unless you have an extension or circumstances, you <strong>MUST</strong> demonstrate your assignment</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="feedback" class="slide level2">
<h1>Feedback</h1>
<ul>
<li>you will receive both:
<ul>
<li>in-class feedback (when you demonstrate)</li>
<li>written feedback on Blackboard</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="optional-video" class="slide level2">
<h1>Optional Video</h1>
<ul>
<li>You may <strong>optionally</strong> create a video of your assignment</li>
<li>This would be valuable to yourself as portfolio work</li>
<li>This would be valuable to the School
<ul>
<li>to illustrate to students in following years what they'll be doing in the module</li>
<li>to enhance recruitment and visibility of the School</li>
<li>to support external examiners in seeing what your assignment looked like, without having to run code</li>
