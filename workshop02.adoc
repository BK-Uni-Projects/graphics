== Overview

* This workshop broadly follows https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle[learnopengl.com's HelloTriangle]
  ** you should refer to this and it's source code for this workshop
  ** you should NOT just copy-paste it's code
    *** you won't learn anything
    *** it may not work

== Where we want to get to

* Have a working HelloTriangle example
  ** that shows a single triangle on screen
* Understand the (many) steps it takes to get just a single triangle on screen
  ** and how they fit in with the pipeline model and OpenGL's state machine
* Show more than one triangle on screen
  ** which turns out to be reasonably easy
* Have an updated build system for OpenGL
* Have modified our {cpp} to use OpenGL for some basic functionality

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system for OpenGL
  ** giving you a version of OpenGL atleast 3.1
    *** preferably 4.3 or 3.3 (or higher)
* Have some log output and error checking

== 1. Read through HelloTriangle

* LearnOpenGL explains the HelloTriangle example really clearly
* Read through the entire webpage
  ** this content is the key to Graphics
  ** we'll be using these ideas throughout the rest of the module
* Write down the major steps needed that are given by LearnOpenGL
* Explain each of those steps to a friend

== 2. Set up key bindings to be useful

* Add useful key bindings for things, such as:
  ** close program
* If you're working from the template, restructure it to your preference
  ** and add a main loop

== 3. Set the viewport

* The viewport controls which part of the window is used for rendering
  ** this should be the whole window, for now

== 4. Vertex Shader

. Create a variable to hold the shader handle (GL justs uses int and unsigned ints!!!!)
. Create a new shader - a *vertex* shader - and assign it to your variable
. Create a variable for the *vertex* shader source, with the appropriate content
. Give this source to OpenGL
. Ask OpenGL to compile your shader
. Check the compilation works
  ** add error checking code
  ** add logging
  ** ALSO - read about https://learnopengl.com/#!In-Practice/Debugging[Debugging]
  ** Use the `glDebugOutput` approach
    *** you *can* use the error printing tool, as is
    *** but make sure you understand what it is doing

== 5. Fragment Shader

. Create a variable to hold the shader handle (GL justs uses int and unsigned ints!!!!)
. Create a new shader - a *fragment* shader - and assign it to your variable
. Create a variable for the *fragment* shader source, with the appropriate content
. Give this source to OpenGL
. Ask OpenGL to compile your shader
. Check the compilation works
  ** add error checking code
  ** add logging
  ** ALSO - read about https://learnopengl.com/#!In-Practice/Debugging[Debugging]
  ** Use the `glDebugOutput` approach
    *** you *can* use the error printing tool, as is
    *** but make sure you understand what it is doing

== 6. GLSL program, and link shaders

. Create a variable for the GLSL program
. Create a new program
. Attached both shaders to the program
  ** *vertex* shader and *fragment* shader
. Ask OpenGL to link the shaders
. Check the linking works
  ** add error checking code
  ** add logging

== 7. Delete shaders

* The shaders are now linked into a new program, and aren't needed any longer
. Ask OpenGL to delete your two shaders

== 8. Vertices

. Create an array to hold your vertices
  ** just an array of floats will be fine for now
  ** we'll make something in the future
  ** these are *only* the *unique* vertices, we'll use indexed rendering

== 9. Indices

. Create an array to hold indices into the vertex array
  ** just an array of ints
    *** could be an array of `char` if only a short vertex array

NOTE: also known as an element array

== 10. Vertex Buffer Object, Element Buffer Object, Vertex Array Object

. Create variables to store handles for:
  .. a Vertex Buffer Object
  .. an Element Buffer Object
  .. a Vertex Array Object
    *** note that the VAO is a different type of object
. Generate handles and store in the variables for:
  .. a Vertex Buffer Object
  .. an Element Buffer Object
  .. a Vertex Array Object

== 11. Bind the Vertex Array Object

. Bind the Vertex Array Object
  ** This makes our VAO the active one
  ** so that our future actions store things in this VAO

== 12. Fill the Vertex Buffer Object

. Bind the Vertex Buffer Object
. Fill it with data from your vertex array

== 13. Fill the Element Buffer Object

. Bind the Element Buffer Object
  ** this makes our VBO no longer bound to `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER`
    *** `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` only stores a single binding
. Fill it with data from your element array

== 14. Tell OpenGL how to access data in the Vertex Buffer Object

. Tell OpenGL how to fill the attribute in location 0 from your Vertex Buffer Object

== 15. Unbind the Buffer Object

. Unbind our Element Buffer Object
  ** by binding `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` to 0
  ** for safety, so we don't accidentally mess with it

== 16. Unbind the Vertex Array Object

. Unbind our Vertex Array Object
  ** by binding the Vertex Array to `0`
  ** for safety, so we don't accidentally change it

== 17. Do the render!! FINALLY

* After clearing the back buffer
. Activate your GLSL program
. Bind your Vertex Array Object (remember, it stores the as objects to read from, and how to read from them)
. Draw your Triangles, using indexed mode
  ** should be in `GL_TRIANGLES` mode
  ** should be made from 3 vertices
. Unbind your Vertex Array Object
  ** for safety

== 18. How does it know which Element Array to use?

* The one we bound in step 13
* We never unbound it
* It would have been better, safer, to unbind after step 13, and bound it when we need it

NOTE: the element array isn't stored in the Vertex Array Object.

== 19. Clean up your resources

. Ask OpenGL to delete:
  .. your Vertex Array Object
  .. your Element Buffer Object
  .. your Vertex Buffer Object
