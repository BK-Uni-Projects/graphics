== Overview

* This workshop broadly follows https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle[learnopengl.com's HelloTriangle]

== Where we want to get to

* Have a working HelloTriangle example
  ** that shows a single triangle on screen
* Understand the (many) steps it takes to get just a single triangle on screen
  ** and how they fit in with the pipeline model and OpenGL's state machine
* Show more than one triangle on screen
  ** which turns out to be reasonably easy
* Have an updated build system for OpenGL
* Have modified our {cpp} to use OpenGL for some basic functionality

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system for OpenGL
  ** giving you a version of OpenGL atleast 3.1
    *** preferably 4.3 or 3.3 (or higher)
* Have some log output and error checking

== 1. Read through HelloTriangle

* LearnOpenGL explains the HelloTriangle example really clearly
* Read through the entire webpage
  ** this content is the key to Graphics
  ** we'll be using these ideas throughout the rest of the module
* Write down the major steps needed that are given by LearnOpenGL
* Explain each of those steps to a friend
