== Stepping through glTriangleWhite with ApiTrace

* http://apitrace.github.io/

[quote, apitrace, http://apitrace.github.io/]
____
apitrace consists of a set of tools to: - trace OpenGL, OpenGL ES,
Direct3D, and DirectDraw APIs calls to a file - replay the recorded
calls from a file, on any machine and, for OpenGL and OpenGL ES, on any
operating system - inspect state at any call while replaying - view
framebuffers and textures - view call data - edit trace files - profile
performance of traces

=== ApiTrace OS support matrix

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|======================
|OS |Trace |CLI |GUI
|Android |yes | |
|Linux |yes |yes |yes
|OS X |yes |yes |yes
|Windows |yes |yes |yes
|======================

== Tracing

* ApiTrace records the exact calls that are made to the OpenGL library, and the responses from OpenGL
* It allows us to step through the trace of a program
  ** one `gl` call at a time
  ** and introspect the `gl` *state* at that point
* Great for debugging
  ** mostly `gl` issues come from the state being different to what you thought it was

=== Tracing - commands

* record a trace
[source, bash]
----
apitrace trace bin/3_1_master-debug
----

* open the trace with the GUI
[source, bash]
----
qapitrace 3_1_master-debug.trace
----

== What are we tracing?

* a moving white triangle on a red background
