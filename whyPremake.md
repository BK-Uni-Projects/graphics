#Why Premake?

- Creating Build systems is surprisingly hard and fiddley
- Want to be able to build our code on multiple platforms and perhaps automatically
- Want to be able to version the build system (and understand it?)
- Premake is a tool that helps with this
- Other tools exist, such as:
  - Gradle
  - Ant
  - Make

##Counter-Example - setting up for Visual Studio

- http://www.programmersranch.com/2014/02/sdl2-setting-up-sdl2-in-visual-studio.html
- it takes 10 very specific steps
  - that's just setting up **one** platform, for **one** library
