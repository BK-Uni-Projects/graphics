#Assessment Methods and Weighting

- Assignment (Coursework)
    - weighting = 70%
- Exam (Closed-book)
    - weighting = 30%

- From the Module Specification - Graphics 2015-16
    - Blackboard=>Graphics (CGP2012M)->About this module

##Learning Outcomes

- Both assessments assess both Learning Outcomes
- Learning Outcome 1

    > design and develop interactive 3D graphics software, applying appropriate mathematical/algorithmic techniques for efficient 2D and 3D graphics
- Learning Outcome 2

    > Demonstrate deep understanding of computer graphics programming techniques and approaches
- Both are *individually* assessed

##What to expect in the assignment

- based around developing an interactive 3D scenario
    - such as a simple computer game:
        - Pong
        - Space Invaders
        - Virtual plane

- will submit to blackboard, but live-demo in the following workshop, affording:
    - faster mark turn around
    - immediate verbal feedback
    - written feedback with mark release
    - opportunity to ask questions

##What features in the assignment will be assessed

- aims to assess practical capability in writing programs that generate 3D graphics and updating the 3D scene based on human input
- requires a set of basic 3D graphics features, such as:
    - 3D geometry
    - 3D (perspective) projections
    - moving/rotating objects
    - moving/rotating view points
    - coloured objects
    - advanced features, such as:
        - lighting simulation
        - texturing.

##What to expect on the Exam

- will assess the more theorectical side of computer graphics
- wider understanding of the area
- questions on the following would be appropriate (examplar, other questions could occur):
    - how standard algorithms or techniques work
    - the factors that affect the performance of graphical systems
    - writing graphics "shaders" from scratch
    - or critique/modify/correct provided "shaders"
