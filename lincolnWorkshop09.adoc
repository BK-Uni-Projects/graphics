Seeing in 3D!! View and Projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* So far, we've only been sending a single 4x4 Matrix into GLSL
** representing the transformation applied to the model (3D object)
* In general, we also want to be able to control the View (the "Camera")
and the Projection (how to go from 3D to 2D) independently from the
Model
* We do this by also passing 4x4 Matrices for those transformation to
GLSL
** viewMatrix
** projectionMatrix
* and applying them in the vertex shader
** `gl_Position = projectionMatrix * viewMatrix * modelMatrix * position;`

[[activities]]
Activities
----------

[[activity-1]]
Activity 1
~~~~~~~~~~

* Starting with a cube (e.g. branch `glCube`)
* Remember that the Identity Matrix has no effect on vertices
** it changes a vertex into itself
* Add a "viewMatrix" to your C++, and set it to the identity Matrix
* pass it into your GLSL, and apply it in your GLSL
* This should have *no* effect - should render as before

[[activity-2]]
Activity 2
~~~~~~~~~~

* Remember that to simulate a "Camera"
** we transform the whole world with the opposite transformation
** that we want to transform the "Camera"
* Alter your viewMatrix (in C++) to transform the view
** e.g. to translate the "Camera" to the left
** do this "manually", don't use the `lookAt` function

[[activity-3]]
Activity 3
~~~~~~~~~~

* Alter your viewMatrix using `glm::lookAt`
** to show the cube from a different viewPoint

[[activity-4]]
Activity 4
~~~~~~~~~~

* Alter your viewMatrix using `glm::lookAt` over time
** to show the cube from a changing viewPoint

[[activity-5]]
Activity 5
~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a "projectionMatrix" to your C++, and set it to the identity
Matrix
* pass it into your GLSL, and apply it in your GLSL
* This should have *no* effect - should render as before

[[activity-6]]
Activity 6
~~~~~~~~~~

* set the projectionMatrix using `glm::ortho`
** but make it have no effect - should render as before

[[activity-7]]
Activity 7
~~~~~~~~~~

* set the projectionMatrix using `glm::ortho`
** but make the cube appear half the size

[[activity-8]]
Activity 8
~~~~~~~~~~

* set the projectionMatrix using `glm::perspective`
** experiment with the parameters

[[activity-9]]
Activity 9
~~~~~~~~~~

* set the projectionMatrix using `glm::perspective`
* and the viewMatrix using any techniques you like
* to show the cube in 3D, with a moving viewpoint

[[stretch-activities]]
Stretch Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*If you've got through the standard activities then have a bash at
these*

1.  Render two cubes (not on top of each other), with a common viewpoint
2.  Render two cubes and a big flat landscape, with a common viewpoint
3.  as 2), but change the viewpoint over time
4.  Make a viewpoint that orbits around the origin
5.  Make a viewpoint that orbits around a moving cube
