== Overview

* This workshop builds on
https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle[learnopengl.com's
HelloTriangle] ** you should refer to this and it's source code for this
workshop ** you should NOT just copy-paste it's code *** you won't learn
anything *** it may not work

== Where we want to get to

* Change what our HelloTriangle renders
  ** make it a different colour
  ** change the shape of the triangle
  ** move the triangle
  ** draw 2 triangles
  ** draw 4 triangles
  ** draw 100 triangles
  ** approximate a circle from a bunch of triangles
* Deepen our understanding the (many) steps it takes to get just a single triangle on
screen
  ** and how they fit in with the pipeline model and OpenGL's state
machine

== Where you should already be

* Have a working HelloTriangle using OpenGL
  ** with atleast OpenGL 3.1, preferably 4.3 or 3.3 (or higher)
* Have some log output and error checking

== 1. Change the colour of the triangle

* Where is the colour of the triangle presently set?
* What do the numbers represent?
. Make the triangle:
  .. Green
  .. Blue
  .. Yellow

== 2. Change the shape of the triangle

* Where are the vertices of the triangle defined?
. Make the triangle:
  .. wider
  .. taller

== 3. Move the triangle

. Position the triangle:
  .. at the top left, with one vertex right in the corner of the window
    *** what range is needed?
  .. at the bottom left
  .. at the top right

== 4. Draw 2 triangles

. What controls how many triangles are drawn?
  ** there are multiple places in the code relavent
. Add vertices for 2 triangles
  ** is this enough?
. Ask OpenGL to draw both triangles

== 5. Draw 4 triangles

. Add vertices for 4 triangles
. Ask OpenGL to draw all 4 triangles

== 6. Draw 100 triangles

. Make storage for 100 triangles
. Fill the storage with data for many triangles
  ** using some algorithm (random would be ok)
  ** make sure all triangles will be visible on the screen
. Ask OpenGL to draw all 100 triangles
. Ask OpenGL to draw just the first 50 triangles
. Ask OpenGL to draw just the second 50 triangles
. Make it change which set of triangles are drawn on a key press

== 7. Approximate a circle from a bunch of triangles

* A circle can be approximated by a set of triangles
. Look up some methods to do this (explanations, not code)
. Implement code to do this
. Make the number of triangles used controlled by a `const` parameter
. Make the number of triangles used changable at run time
