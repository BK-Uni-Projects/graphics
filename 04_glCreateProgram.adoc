GLuint program = glCreateProgram();
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glCreateProgram.xhtml[glCreateProgram]

* returns a non-zero value by which it can be referenced
* in this case the ID is *3*

=== glCreateProgram - context

glAttachShader(program, shaderList[iLoop]);
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glAttachShader.xhtml[glCreateProgram]

with ID=**1 (our vertex shader)**

=== glBindAttribLocation

* this call doesn't actually exist in our program - it's been inserted
by either SDL or a higher-level part of OpenGL
* **but**, we could have called it ourselves, if we wanted to choose the
AttribLocation
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glBindAttribLocation.xhtml[glBindAttribLocation]
Associates a generic vertex attribute index with a named attribute
variable
* in this case associates attribute index **0**, on our program with
ID=3, with the GLSL name *position*

=== glBindAttribLocation - context

* our GLSL program with ID=**3** now has *position* associated with
attribute index *0*

----
glLinkProgram(program);
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glBindAttribLocation.xhtml[glLinkProgram]
Links a program object
* in this case out GLSL program with ID=**3**
* status of the link operation will be stored as part of the program
object's state

image::assets/apitrace/04_glCreateProgram/05_glLinkProgram.png[05_glLinkProgram.png]

=== glLinkProgram - context

* our GLSL program now has a *linked program* in it, which we need to
check the link status of
* this program exists separately from the attached shaders
* nothing else has changed

[source,cpp]
----
glGetProgramiv(program, GL_LINK_STATUS, &status););
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glGetProgram.xhtml[glGetProgramiv]
Returns a parameter from a program object
* in this case get the GL_LINK_STATUS - if the linking worked

image::assets/apitrace/04_glCreateProgram/06_glGetProgramiv.png[06_glGetProgramiv.png]

=== glGetProgramiv - context

* no context change - this is a *get* function
* remember: *get* functions tend to be relatively expensive

----
glDetachShader(program, shaderList[iLoop]);
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glDetachShader.xhtml[glDetachShader]

* in this case we are detaching from the program with ID=**3**, the
shader with ID=**1 (our vertex shader)**

----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glGetAttribLocation.xhtml[glGetAttribLocation]
Returns the location of an attribute variable
* in this case we are getting the location of attribute *position* in

* which is 0
