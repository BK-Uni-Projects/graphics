== Textures

== Why use textures

* Textures are typically used to add visual detail to models without
adding geometric detail
* Textures are in fact just data stores, much like VertexBufferObjects
  ** we can use them to store all sort of things
  ** access this data (fairly) arbitrarily from GLSL (unlike VBOs)
* It's possible to have 1D, 2D and even 3D textures
* We'll focus on using textures for images, and applying them to
geometry

== Creating Textures and Binding

* Similarly to VertexBufferObjects, we have to ask OpenGL to create
Textures (or texture objects) for us

[source,cpp]

----
GLuint textureID; //storage for a textureID
glGenTextures(1, &textureID); //create 1 texture id and store it in textureID
----

* In order to do things with a texture object, we have to bind it
  ** we'll bind to GL_TEXTURE_2D as images are 2D arrays of pixels

[source,cpp]
----
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex); //make textureID the active 2D texture
----

== Texture Coordinates

* When drawing we want to able to refer to parts of a texture
* We do this with *Texture Coordinates*
  ** aka _UV Coordinates_ or _ST Coordinates_
* Texture Coordinates range from `0.0` to `1.0`
* `(0,0)` is usually the bottom-left of the image
* `(1,1)` is usually the top-right of the image

== Getting data from textures

* *Sampling* is the process of retrieving data from a texture object
  ** usually color data
* We can control how the sampling occurs, to match our circumstances

== Texture Wrapping

* What should happen if we try to sample a texture outside the `0.0` to
`1.0` range?
  ** we still want the sampler to return a value
  ** `GL_REPEAT` - the integer part of the coordinate will be ignored and
a repeating pattern is formed
  ** `GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT` - the texture will also be repeated, but it will
be *mirrored* when the integer part of the coordinate is odd
  ** `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE` - coordinates will be *clamped* to the `0.0` to
`1.0` range
  ** `GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER` - coordinates outside the range will be given a
specific border color

== Texture Wrapping examples

* from https://open.gl/textures

== S, T, R coordinates and wrapping

* texture coordinates are just vectors:
  ** 1D texturing - `float`
  ** 2D texturing - `vec2`
  ** 3D texturing - `vec3`
* when using a `vec` for textures we call the coordinates `s`, `t`, and `r`
  ** instead of `x`, `y`, and `z`
* coordinate wrapping can be set per coordinate
  ** i.e. it can be different on each axis

== Setting texture wrapping

* texture parameters are set with the `glTexParameter*` command
  ** the star refers to the `type` of value you wish to set

[source,cpp]
----
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_REPEAT);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_REPEAT);
----

== Texture filtering

* texture coordinates are resolution independent
* usually, they don't always match a pixel exactly
  ** so a texture image is stretched beyond its original size
  ** or it's sized down

== Texture filtering options

* we can ask OpenGL to use specifics methods in deciding on the sampled color
  ** `GL_NEAREST` - returns the pixel that is closest to the coordinates
  ** `GL_LINEAR` - returns the weighted average of the 4 pixels surrounding the given coordinates
  ** `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST` - later
  ** `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST` - later
  ** `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR` - later
  ** `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` - later

== Specifying Texture Filtering

* we can specify the kind of interpolation separately for:
  ** scaling the image down - "__minification__" - `GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER`
  ** scaling the image up - "__magnification__" - `GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER`

[source,cpp]
----
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
----

== MipMaps !!!

* we previously mentioned Mipmaps for texturing, but didn't define them
* Mipmaps are smaller copies of your texture that have been sized down
and filtered in advance
* It is recommended that you use them because they result in both a
higher quality and higher performance

[source,cpp]
----
glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D); //generate mipmaps for the present texture
----

== Mipmap Examples

image::mipmapExample.jpg[mipmapExample]

== Using mipmaps

* just set the filtering method
  ** `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST` - use the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel being textured and sample it with nearest neighbour interpolation
  ** `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST` - samples the closest mipmap with linear interpolation
  ** `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR` - uses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel being textured and samples with nearest neighbour interpolation
  ** ```GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` - samples closest two mipmaps with linear interpolation

== Loading texture images

* so far we've only setup a texture object
* next step is to load that object with data
  ** usually an image
  ** but, generally, just an set of bytes

== An example texture image in cpp

[source,cpp]
----
// Black/white checkerboard
float pixels[] = { //a simple 2x2 image
    0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,   1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,
    1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,   0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f
};
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, 2, 2, 0, GL_RGB, GL_FLOAT, pixels);
----

== glTexImage2D parameters

`glTexImage2D(textureTarget, levelOfDetail, internalPixelFormat, width, height, alwaysZero, externalPixelFormat, externalPixelType, pixelData);`

* textureTarget = `GL_TEXTURE_1D`, `GL_TEXTURE_2D`, `GL_TEXTURE_3D`
* levelOfDetail = level-of-detail, where 0 is the base image
  ** used for loading mipmap images - where you can control each level
* internalPixelFormat = the format pixels should be stored on the
*graphics card*
  ** lots of formats are available, including compressed formats
* width = of the image (2D array of data)
* height = of the image (2D array of data)

== glTexImage2D parameters 2

* alwaysZero = should always have a value of 0 per the specification
* externalPixelFormat = format of the pixels in the array that will be
loaded
  ** e.g. RGB, RGBA, BGR, ...
* externalPixelType = type for each component
  ** e.g. float, uint, ...
* pixelData = the data array itself
  ** begins loading the image at coordinate (0,0)

== Loading texture images from files

* textures can be in formats natively supported by the hardware
  ** e.g. DDS
* or in a more common image format
  ** e.g. JPEG, PNG, BMP
* OpenGL just does rendering
  ** no support for load pixels from image files
* SDL2 supports loading BMP images
* other libraries can help loading other formats
  ** e.g. Soil, Resil

[source,cpp]
----
SDL_Surface* image = SDL_LoadBMP("assets/hello.bmp");
----

== State of the art Report

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_compression[Compressed textures] are great
* Especially formats that are still compressed on the GPU
  ** smaller in transfer
  ** smaller in GPU
  ** faster (just load straight to GPU, not CPU work to do)
* For state of the art, see
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_Texture_Compression[ETC1]
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression[S3 Texture Compression]
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Scalable_Texture_Compression[Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression]
  ** http://www.binomial.info/[basis - texture compressor]

== Texture Coordinates

* Textures are sampled using texture coordinates
  ** UV or ST coordinates
* We have to add these as attributes to the GLSL
* and load texture coordinates into a vertexBufferObject
  ** usually the same VBO as the position data
  ** either [allPositions, allTextureCoordnates]
  ** or [position0, textureCoordinate0, position1, textureCoordinate1,
...]

=== Texture Coordinate example

[source,cpp]
----
float vertices[] = {
//  Position      Color             Texcoords
    -0.5f,  0.5f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, // Top-left
     0.5f,  0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, // Top-right
     0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, // Bottom-right
    -0.5f, -0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f  // Bottom-left
};
----

=== Example vertex shader

The vertex shader needs to be modified so that the texture coordinates
are interpolated over the fragments:

[source,glsl]
----
...
in vec2 texcoord;
out vec3 Color;
out vec2 Texcoord;
...
void main()
{
    Texcoord = texcoord;
...
----

=== Example fragment shader

[source,glsl]
----
#version 150
in vec3 Color;
in vec2 Texcoord;
out vec4 outColor;
uniform sampler2D tex;
void main()
{
    outColor = texture(tex, Texcoord) * vec4(Color, 1.0);
}
----

=== Texture Units

* each sampler in bound to a texture unit
* by default texture unit 0
* texture units are references to texture objects that can be sampled in
a shader
* use `glBindTexture` to bind to a texture object to the active texture
unit
* use `glActiveTexture` to make a specific textureUnit the active one
  ** e.g. `glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);`
* the OpenGL specification says that at least 48 texture units should be
supported
  ** which means we can have multiple texture units in one GLSL program
  ** and therefore multiple samplers and texture objects
  ** this allows lots of flexibility and for features such as
*multiTexturing*
