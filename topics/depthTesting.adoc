== Depth Testing

== Why depth testing

* without depth testing each triangle rendered draws on top of previous pixels
* this causes problems
* TWO general solutions
  ** resolve depth per polygon (Painter's Algorithm)
  ** resolve depth per pixel (fragment) (Depth Testing/Z-buffer)

== Painter's Algorithm

* we could try to draw all far away triangles first
* then draw nearer ones
  ** requires *sorting* the triangles
    *** expensive
  ** this is called the Painter's Algorithm
  ** doesn't work for all cases ...
    *** cyclic overlap
    *** piercing polygons

== Painter's Algorithm - failure cases

* can be solved by cutting the offending polygons, to then allow sorting - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell%27s_algorithm[Newell's algorithm]

== What is Depth Testing

* depth test is a per-sample operation performed conceptually after the
Fragment Shader
  ** under some circumstances it can occur *before* frag shader ("early-Z"), but ...
* output depth may be tested against the depth of the sample being written to
  ** requires storing depth (a Z-value) per fragment - the *Z-buffer*
* if the test fails, the fragment is discarded
* if the test passes, the colour and depth buffers may be written to (usually will do)
* writing to the depth/colour buffer is a relatively slow operation, so minimizing writes is a good optimization
  ** how could depth testing support this?
[%step]
    *** sort and draw *nearest* first - minimizes writes

== Depth Test In Practice

. setup depth testing - anywhere before rendering
  ** make sure our *context* has a z-buffer
  ** we *can* turn it on and off *during* rendering, for advanced use cases
. clear the depth buffer before rendering
  ** we *can* clear it more often (or just parts of it), for advanced use cases
. [OPTIONAL] set the "Depth Function" - specifies the depth comparison function
  ** default is `GL_LESS`

== Depth Test In Practice (example)

* *assuming* we have set up a z-buffer - SDL2 does this automatically for you

[source,cpp]
----
// initialise
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); // enable testing
glDepthFunc(GL_LESS); //only write if z is less (nearer)

// per frame
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); //clear depth buffer before rendering
render();
----

== Depth Testing issues

* the depth is represented using a number
  ** usually a floating point number, commonly a 32-bit float
* only some depths can be represented (limited precision)
  ** floating points errors and limitations are relevant
* in other words, if polygons are near each the errors in the calculated z-values may cause visual aftifacts
  ** fragments may be incorrectly discarded
  ** this is caused z-fighting
* particularly this happens with polygons on top of each other, or a long way away
  ** floating point has less precision for larger values
