== What Is GLSL?

* a high-level shading language
* based on the syntax of the C programming language
** importantly *different* from C
* https://www.opengl.org/documentation/glsl/

== GLSL and the OpenGL pipeline

* GLSL is how you *program* the OpenGL pipeline
** for the DirectX pipeline you use HLSL
** there are other tools also
* GLSL programs are compiled at *run-time*
** by *your* program
** you've already been *unknowingly* doing this ...
* GLSL programs are also called *shaders*

== GLSL and the OpenGL pipeline 2

* GLSL programs run in very *specific* points in the OpenGL pipeline
* Each point in the pipeline takes a different *type* of GLSL program
** what *types* of GLSL programs are there
** *where* (in the pipeline) does each run?
** what are the *inputs* and *outputs* of each?

== The inescapable GLSL

* Modern OpenGL (i.e. 3.0 upwards) *REQUIRES* you to use *GLSL programs*
* You *must* provide at least one *vertex program* and one *fragment
program*

== Version fun ;-)

* Just like OpenGL there are many versions of GLSL
* You have to match your GLSL version to your OpenGL version
** i.e. if you create an OpenGL 3.3 context then you *must* use GLSL 3.3
*** for _limited_ values of __must__. Some drivers are quite tolerant

== GL vs GLSL version numbering

[quote, GL vs GLSL versions, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language#Versions]
____
GLSL versions have evolved alongside specific versions of the OpenGL
API. It is only with OpenGL versions 3.3 and above that the GLSL and
OpenGL major and minor version numbers match. These versions for GLSL
and OpenGL are related in the following table.
