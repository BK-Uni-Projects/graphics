== Introduction to Graphics

== A set of materials for learning 3D Computer Graphics

* focused on modern-style OpenGL
* i.e. OpenGL version 3.1 and later
* examples (in git branches)
* setup for _safe_ live-coding (i.e. in-class demos)
* easy to "diff" between branches
* technically in C++, but most of the code is pure C
** not using any classes and the OpenGL API is a C interface

== What Materials Exist?

* lectures
* workshop activities
* very hands-on

== Work-in-progress

* this is a work in progress
* you are encourage to get involved
* interact on github
  ** https://github.com/shearer12345/graphics
* raise issues
  ** for things that don't work
  ** for things that you don't find clear
  ** for "feature" requests
* send pull-requests
  ** for fixes
  ** for new features

== What we'll cover

=== Fundamentals

* The basic operations for OpenGL (in C)
* Core of the OpenGL pipeline
* Core information about how OpenGL and Graphics rendering works
* How the OpenGL pipeline works
* The basic flow of information is within OpenGL
