== What's a model?

* A bunch of stuff that lets us render an entity
  ** perhaps other non-render related stuff
* What kind of stuff?
  ** ???

== What's (usually) in a model (file)?

[.step]
* geometry
  ** vertices
  ** how they are connected (triangles? quads?)
* colours

== What's (usually) in a model (file)?

[.step]
* material (surface) properties
  ** texture coordinates
  ** normals
* animations
  ** bones
  ** morpth targets
  ** key-frame data

== What's (usually) in a model (file)? 2

* sometimes refers to other files
  ** especially for texture data

== What in a model (file) do you want/need?

[.step]

== File formats

* Let's name some ...

== File formats - a list

[.step]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)[.stl - **ST**ereo**L**ithography]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file[.obj - Wavefront OBJ (Object?)]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)[.ply - Polygon File Format]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX[.fbx - **F**ilm**B**o**x**]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.3ds[.3ds - Autodesk 3D Studio Max]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA[.dae - Collada (**COLLA**borative **D**esign **A**ctivity)]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#File_format[.blend - Blender File format]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF[.gltf - GL Transmission Format]
* Many, many others

== File formats - text vs binary

* we've discussed this before, but thoughts?
  ** ??

== A closer look at some formats

* let's have a look at the wikipedia entries, because they're pretty good
  ** but, obviously, non-authoratative
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)[.stl - **ST**ereo**L**ithography]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file[.obj - Wavefront OBJ (Object?)]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF[.gltf - GL Transmission Format]

== Importing models - features we want

* What features do we want from our model loader?
  ** ???

== Importing models - features we want 2

[.step]
* loads at least one format
  ** in fact, one subset of one format
* reasonably quick
* reasonably memory efficient
* error checks, recovers
  ** external files are untrusted and frequently "bad"
* let's us know what texture files to load

== Importing model s - what will we need to do

* take the geometry we've loaded (ourselves or with ASSIMP) and give it to OpenGL
* set up our render appropriately
* start small
  ** with very simple geometry (export a cube from Blender?)
  ** adding one feature at a time
    *** i.e. start with *just* vertices - perhaps just render as GL_POINTS
* use a default texture initially?

== Tools / Libraries

* Do it yourself
  ** look at the file formats - especially text formats
* Use an existing library
  ** *except only allowed to use ASSIMP for this module*

== ASSIMP

* An open-source model import library
  ** http://www.assimp.org/
* loads http://www.assimp.org/main_features_formats.html[*many* file formats]
* also supports some http://www.assimp.org/main_features_export.html[export formats]
* can do http://www.assimp.org/main_features_pp.html[post-processing]
* "The library is not designed for speed"

== ASSIMP - video examples

== ASSIMP tutorials / samples

* https://learnopengl.com/#!Model-Loading/Assimp
* https://github.com/assimp/assimp/tree/master/samples/SimpleTexturedOpenGL

== ASSIMP from conan.io

* An Assimp package is available on conan.io (Windows only)
  ** https://www.conan.io/source/assimp/3.3.1/lasote/vcpkg
* The SDL2 template (glTemplate branch) uses this
  ** https://github.com/shearer12345/sdl2template/tree/glTemplate

== Where to find models?

* Make sure you have license to use them
  ** *especially* if you want to publish/showcase your game
* Why do you know?
  ** ...

== Where to find models? 2

* Assimp has a bunch of BSD licensed model for its testing
  ** in *many* different formats
  ** https://github.com/assimp/assimp/tree/master/test/models
