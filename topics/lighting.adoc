== Lighting

== What visual features are we looking for

* surfaces angled away from lights are less well lit
* curved surfaces show specular highlights
* objects obscure each other's light (shadows)

== Diffuse vs Specular

image::lighting_diffuseVsSpecular.gif[lighting_diffuseVsSpecular]

== Phong lighting model

* aka __Phong reflection model__, _Phong illumination_
* *Bui Tuong Phong* at the University of Utah
* *1973!!!*
* *NOT* the only lighting model, but used very frequently in Games

=== Phong lighting model 2

* from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model

image::phongComponents.png[phongComponents]

=== Phong lighting model 3

* *model* of *local* illumination
  ** model?
  ** local?
* describes the way a surface reflects light as a combination of
  ** the diffuse reflection of rough surfaces
  ** the specular reflection of shiny surfaces
* also an ambient term to model light that is scattered about the entire
scene

=== Phong lighting model 4

* you specify these three "types" of lighting separately
  ** this is *NOT* connected to reality!
  ** but does keep things relatively simple
* you also have to specify properties of lights and surfaces
* i.e. it ends up as a *large* number of parameters

=== Phong Vectors

image::lighting_blinnVectors.png[lighting_blinnVectors]

=== Phong Vectors 2

* direction of incident light = stem:[\hat{L}_m]
* direction of reflected light = stem:[\hat{R}_m]
* the importance of the viewing position = stem:[\hat{V}]
* normal to the surface = stem:[\hat{N}]

== Light Sources

* each light source in the scene has an *intensity* for
  ** specular component - stem:[i_\text{s}]
  ** diffuse components - stem:[i_\text{d}]
  ** usually RGB values
* there is (in this model) a single term that controls the ambient
lighting
  ** can be computed as a sum of contributions from all light sources
  ** stem:[i_\text{a}]

== Materials

* each surface in the scene has an associated material specifying how
that surface reflects the various *"types"* of light.
  ** this *may* be stored in textures for more lighting detail
  ** specular reflection coefficient - what proportion of incoming
"specular" light is reflected
    *** stem:[k_\text{s}]
  ** diffuse reflection coefficient - stem:[k_\text{d}]
  ** ambient reflection coefficient - stem:[k_\text{a}]
* plus a *shininess* constant for the material - stem:[\alpha]

== Phong reflection model

* stem:[\hat{L}_m] - direction of incident light
* stem:[\hat{R}_m] - direction of reflected light
* stem:[\hat{V}] - the importance of the viewing position
* stem:[\hat{N}] - normal to the surface
* stem:[i_\text{s}] - specular component
* stem:[i_\text{d}] - diffuse component
* stem:[i_\text{a}] - ambient component
* stem:[k_\text{s}] - specular reflection coefficient
* stem:[k_\text{d}] - diffuse reflection coefficient
* stem:[k_\text{a}] - ambient reflection coefficient
* stem:[\alpha] - shininess
* stem:[I_\text{p}] = illumination of each surface point

== Phong reflection model 2

stem:[I_\text{p} = k_\text{a} i_\text{a} + \sum_{m\;\in\;\text{lights}} (k_\text{d} (\hat{L}_m \cdot \hat{N}) i_{m,\text{d}} + k_\text{s} (\hat{R}_m \cdot \hat{V})^{\alpha}i_{m,\text{s}})]

== Reflection vector

direction vector stem:[\hat{R}_m] is calculated as the reflection
of stem:[\hat{L}_m] on the surface characterized by the surface
normal stem:[\hat{N}] using

stem:[\hat{R}_m = 2(\hat{L}_m\cdot \hat{N})\hat{N} - \hat{L}_m ]

* hats indicate that the vectors are normalized

== Phong reflection model properties

* diffuse term is not affected by the viewer direction
(stem:[\hat{V}])
* specular term is large only when the viewer direction
(stem:[\hat{V}]) is aligned with the reflection direction
stem:[\hat{R}_m]
  ** their alignment is measured by the stem:[\alpha] power of the
cosine of the angle between them
  ** the cosine of the angle between the normalized vectors
stem:[\hat{R}_m] and stem:[\hat{V}] is equal to their *dot
product*
  ** when stem:[\alpha] is large, in the case of a nearly
mirror-like reflection, the specular highlight will be small
    *** because any viewpoint not aligned with the reflection will have a
cosine less than one which rapidly approaches zero when raised to a high
power

== Lighting per-vertex vs per-fragment

* we can apply the lighting model at
  ** each *vertex*
  ** or each *fragment*

image::lighting_none_per-vertex_and_per-fragment.png[lighting_none_per-vertex_and_per-fragment]

* computational cost

== Physically-based rendering

* leverages research on light transport
  ** rather than made-up approximations that "look right"
