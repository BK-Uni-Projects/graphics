== OpenGL

* a C library for graphics rendering
* usually utilises the underlying hardware graphics accelerator
(graphics card)

== SDL2

* context creation, windowing, input handling
* OpenGL *only* does rendering, we need other tools for a number of
jobs:
* to setup a "context" that OpenGL can use
* to create and manipulate windows
* to handle input
* ...

== C / {cpp}

* OpenGL provides a C-style API (Application Program Interface)
* that API can be used from C or C++
* or the API can be wrapped for use from other languages (e.g. Java,
Python)
