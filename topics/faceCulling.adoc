== Face Culling

== What is Face Culling

* Triangle primitives after all transformation steps have a particular
facing
* This is defined by the apparent order on-screen of the three vertices
* Triangles can be discarded based on their apparent facing, a process
known as Face Culling

=== What is Face Culling 2

* Triangle primitives after all transformation steps have a particular
facing
* This is defined by the apparent order on-screen of the three vertices
* Triangles can be discarded based on their apparent facing, a process
known as Face Culling

== Winding order

* every vertex in every part of the rendering pipeline has a specific
order
* we submit vertices in a specific sequence
* each vertex in the Primitive Assembly stage is still ordered
* the order of the vertices in a triangle can be combined with their
relative visual orientation to determine whether the triangle is being
seen from the "front" or the "back" side
  ** this is the *winding order*

=== Winding order 2

==Front face

* the face to be the "front" face is controlled by:
  ** `glFrontFace(mode)`
  ** `mode` may be `GL_CW` or `GL_CCW`
  ** This is global state
    *** but, you can change it between rendering each object
  ** Default is `GL_CCW`

=== Face Culling Effciency 1

* an *optimization*
  ** for solid objects stops at least 50% of triangles (see next)
  ** occurs after the vertex shader, before rasterization
* in limited cases, can help things render correctly
  ** i.e. when not using depth testing, but rendering a single, solid object

=== Face Culling Efficiency 2

* A cube is made of 12 triangles
* 6 of them will be facing in the opposite direction from the other 6
* Unless the cube is   **transparent  **:
  ** 6 of the triangles will always be covered up by the other 6
  ** In fact, depending on the projection, more than 6 triangles could be covered
* Face culling allows non-visible triangles of closed surfaces to be culled before expensive Rasterization and Fragment Shader operations.

* `glmRotateColorCubeNoCullingNoDepthTest`
* `glmRotateColorCubeWithCullingNoDepthTest`
* anywhere before rendering
