== What Is OpenGL?

* A _real_ API
* There are a number of languages that have implemented it
** but it all comes back to C in the end
* and guess what language weâ€™re running the course in?
* The API, in C, is defined by a number of `typedefs`, `#defined`
enumerator values, and `functions`
** `typedefs` define basic GL types like `GLint`, `GLfloat` and so forth
** Complex aggregates like structs are never directly exposed in OpenGL

* Not actual OpenGL commands but..
* OpenGL *owns the storage* for all OpenGL objects
** the user can only access an object **by reference**.
** almost all OpenGL objects are referred to by an unsigned integer (the
**GLuint**)

* Objects are created by a function of the form **`glGen*`**, where * is
the type of the object

** `GLuint*` array that receives the newly created object names

== Explaining C and OpenGL 6

* To modify most objects, they must first be *bound* to the context

* Many objects can be bound to different locations in the context
  ** this allows the same object to be used in different ways

== Explaining C and OpenGL 8

* Functions that actually change values within the object are given a
target parameter
** so that they could modify objects bound to different targets

[source,c]
----
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, An integer that points to an object, A new float value)
----

* Note: All OpenGL objects are not as simple as this example, and the
functions that change object state do *not all follow* these naming
conventions

== The Structure of OpenGL

* The OpenGL API is defined as a state machine
* Almost all of the OpenGL functions *set* or *retrieve* some state in
OpenGL
  ** the only functions that do not change state are functions that use
the currently set state to cause *rendering to happen*
  ** _except a bunch of other functions that we'll pretend don't exist_
* Think of the state machine as a very large `struct` with a great many
different fields called the *OpenGL context*
  ** each field in the context represents some information necessary for
rendering

== The Structure of OpenGL 2

* Objects in OpenGL are thus defined as
** a list of fields in this struct that can be saved and restored
* Binding an object to a target within the context causes
** the data in this object to replace some of the context's state
* After binding, future function calls that read from or modify this
context state will
** read or modify the state within the object

//Create the storage for the object
GLuint objectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY,GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
----

== Objects in OpenGL 2

* Objects are usually represented as `GLuint` integers
** these are handles to the actual OpenGL objects
* The **integer value 0 is special**; it acts as the object equivalent
of a `NULL` pointer
** binding object *0* means to *unbind* the currently bound object
* This means that the **original context state**, the state that was in
place before the binding took place, now becomes the context state

== The OpenGL Specification

* the specification defines
** the initial OpenGLstate
** what each function does to change or retrieve it
** what happens when you call a rendering function
* The most important thing to understand about the specification is it
describes **results**, *not implementation*

== The ARB

* The specification is written by the OpenGL *Architectural Review
Board* (ARB)
** a group of representatives from companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and AMD
(the ATI part), among others
** The ARB is part of the *Khronos Group*
** https://www.opengl.org/archives/about/arb/

== The OpenGL Specification 2

* The OpenGL ARB controls the **specification**, but it does not control
OpenGL's code
* It is up to the developers of that hardware to write an OpenGL
*Implementation* for that hardware

== Who controls / builds the implementations

* Who controls the OpenGL implementation is different for different
operating systems:
** on **Windows**, OpenGL implementations are controlled virtually
entirely by the hardware makers themselves
** on **Mac OSX**, OpenGL implementations are controlled by Apple
** ON **linux**, you have:
*** closed-source hardware controlled implementations
*** open-source hardware directed implementations
*** open source implementations
*** ...
* The upshot of this is if you are writing a program and it seems to be
exhibiting off-spec behaviour, the fault is with the maker of your
OpenGL implementation

== And finally, just for fun...

* There are many versions of the OpenGL Specification
** https://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/
* OpenGL versions are not like most Direct3D versions, which typically
change most of the API
* Code that works on one version of OpenGL will almost always work on
later versions of OpenGL
** i.e. the hardware usually supports older versions
** though not neccasraily efficiently
