##CRG Note 1

- the **Advanced** Criterion are designed to be set with weightings such that not all **advanced** criterion are required to achieve full marks
    - in other words: the total weightings for the criteria will add up to more than 100%
    - allowing optionality on the **advanced** criteria
- **standard** Criteria are weighted at 8% points each
    - there are 8 of these
- **advanced** Criteria are weighted at 18% points each
    - you can achieve full marks by only implementing two advanced criteria
    - there are 4 of these to choose from
    - you can do as many advanced criteria as you choose
- the overall mark will be capped at 100%

##Example marks

- To make the CRG weighting scheme clearer, we'll look at a few examples of marks
- For the example *pp* stands for **percentage points**

##Example marks - Jayne

- Jayne does all the **standard** criteria and two of the **advanced** criteria
- Jayne achieves 60% for all the criteria (standard and advanced)
- *pp* achieved in **standard**
    - 8 criteria, each worth 8*pp*, each at 60%
    - = 8 * 8 * 0.60
    - = 38.4*pp*
- *pp* achieved in **advanced**
    - 2 criteria, each worth 18*pp*, each at 60%
    - = 2 * 18 * 0.60
    - = 21.6*pp*
- Jayne achieves a total mark of
    - 38.4*pp* + 21.6*pp*
    - **= 60*pp* = 60%**

##Example marks - Harley

- Harley does all the **standard** criteria
    - achieves 60% each for the **standard** criteria
- Harley does four of the **advanced** criteria
    - achieves 60% for one of them
    - achieves 20% for the other three
- *pp* achieved in **standard**
    - 8 criteria, each worth 8*pp*, each at 60%
    - = 8 * 8 * 0.60
    - = 38.4*pp*
- *pp* achieved in **advanced**
    - 1 criteria, worth 18*pp*, at 60%
    - plus 3 criteria, each worth 18*pp*, at 20%
    - = ( 1 * 18 * 0.60 ) + ( 3 * 18 * 0.20 )
    - = 10.8*pp* + 10.8*pp* = 21.6*pp*
- Harley achieves a total mark of
    - 38.4*pp* + 21.6*pp*
    - **= 60*pp* = 60%**

##Example marks - Charlie

- Charlie does all the **standard** criteria
    - achieves 80% each for the **standard** criteria
- Charlie does one of the **advanced** criteria
    - achieves 80% for one of them
- *pp* achieved in **standard**
    - 8 criteria, each worth 8*pp*, each at 80%
    - = 8 * 8 * 0.80
    - = 51.2*pp*
- *pp* achieved in **advanced**
    - 1 criteria, worth 18*pp*, at 80%
    - = 1 * 18 * 0.80
    - = 14.4*pp*
- Charlie achieves a total mark of
    - 51.2*pp* + 14.4*pp*
    - **= 65.6*pp* **

##Any combinations are valid

- so, any combinations of criteria on the CRG are valid
- **BUT** you don't **have** to do all of them
    - that is not the expectation
- the overall mark will be **capped at 100%**
