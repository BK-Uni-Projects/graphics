#Visual Studio Quirks

- Visual Studio **may** want to *retarget* the solution to the new version
    - allow that

- You may need to *retarget* the solution yourself
    - Visual Studio will tell you so if you try to build
    - `projectMenu->retarget` or `right-click solution->retarget`

- In Lab A, on Windows 8.1, the file assignments are confused
    - double-clicking a `.sln` file opens VS2010 (Which doesn't work) instead of VS2013
    - Just Open VS2013 yourself and load the solution
