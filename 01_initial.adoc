== Apitrace - Initial state

=== Initialisation

* Frame 0 contained all the stuff the SDL2 and GLEW did for us
** e.g. setting of the framebuffer details, asking GL for function
pointers
** there's nothing interesting for us here
* We'll start look at Frame 1, which as the first call to *GL* that
we've made (that we're interested in)
* At this point the context (the OpenGL state) is almost brand new

=== Initial state

* Initially, every variable in the OpenGL state (of *our* context) is
set to a default
* There are many variables in the OpenGL state.
* We are interested in only a small subset

=== ApiTrace initially, with whole state

* note the thumbnails on the left are from the *end* of each frame

=== ApiTrace initially, only showing non-default state

* debug is enabled
* we've set the viewport, so viewport and scissor box are set
* our window is 600x600, so the viewport covers the whole window
** we've set the viewport explicitly, to allow apiTrace to replay
properly

=== Apitrace initially, with an unfilled back buffer (GL_BACK)

* at this point the back buffer hasn't been filled
** it is just whatever happens to be whatever the GPU has in RAM already
in the allocated area

=== Apitrace initially, with a unfilled back buffer (GL_BACK) - ZOOM

* large view of the back buffer
* filled with random stuff that's being rendered previously
* *fun days*

=== Apitrace initially, with no _uniform_ variables set

* initially no _uniform_ variables are set
