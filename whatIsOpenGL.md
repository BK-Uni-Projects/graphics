#What Is OpenGL?

- A *real* API
- There are a number of languages that have implemented it
    - but it all comes back to C in the end
   - and guess what language weâ€™re running the course in?
- The API, in C, is defined by a number of `typedefs`, `#defined` enumerator values, and `functions`
    - `typedefs` define basic GL types like `GLint`, `GLfloat` and so forth
    - Complex aggregates like structs are never directly exposed in OpenGL

##C/C++ and OpenGL

```C
structObject{
    int anInteger;
    float aFloat;
    char *aString;
};

//Create the storage for the object.
ObjectnewObject;

//Put data into the object.
newObject.anInteger= 5;
newObject.aFloat= 0.4f;
newObject.aString= "Some String";
```

```C
//Create the storage for the object
GLuintobjectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
```

##Explaining C and OpenGL

```C
//Create the storage for the object
GLuintobjectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
```

- Not actual OpenGL commands but..
- OpenGL **owns the storage** for all OpenGL objects
    - the user can only access an object **by reference**.
    - almost all OpenGL objects are referred to by an unsigned integer (the **GLuint**)
        - **?? OMG !!**

##Explaining C and OpenGL

```C
GLuintobjectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
```

- Objects are created by a function of the form **`glGen*`**, where * is the type of the object
```C
glGen*(No.of objects to create)
```
    - `GLuint*` array that receives the newly created object names

---

##Explaining C and OpenGL

```C
GLuintobjectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
```

- To modify most objects, they must first be **bound** to the context

```C
GL_BindObject(Thefictitious targetisthelocation where, ObjectNameisbound)
```

- Many objects can be bound to different locations in the context
    - this allows the same object to be used in different ways

---

##Explaining C and OpenGL

```C
GLuintobjectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
```

- Functions that actually change values within the object are given a target parameter
    - so that they could modify objects bound to different targets

```C
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, An integer that points to an object, A new float value)
```

- Note: All OpenGL objects are not as simple as this example, and the functions that change object state do **not all follow** these naming conventions

##The Structure of OpenGL

- The OpenGL API is defined as a state machine
- Almost all of the OpenGL functions **set** or **retrieve** some state in OpenGL
    - the only functions that do not change state are functions that use the currently set state to cause **rendering to happen**
    - *except a bunch of other functions that we'll pretend don't exist*
- Think of the state machine as a very large `struct` with a great many different fields called the **OpenGL context**
    - each field in the context represents some information necessary for rendering

##The Structure of OpenGL

- Objects in OpenGL are thus defined as
    - a list of fields in this struct that can be saved and restored
- Binding an object to a target within the context causes
    - the data in this object to replace some of the context's state
- After binding, future function calls that read from or modify this context state will
    - read or modify the state within the object

---

##Objects in OpenGL

```C
//Create the storage for the object
GLuint objectName;
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY,objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY,GL_OBJECT_AN_INTEGER, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_FLOAT, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_A_STRING, "Some String");
```

- Objects are usually represented as `GLuint` integers
    - these are handles to the actual OpenGL objects
- The **integer value 0 is special**; it acts as the object equivalent of a `NULL` pointer
    - binding object **0** means to **unbind** the currently bound object
- This means that the **original context state**, the state that was in place before the binding took place, now becomes the context state

---

##The OpenGLSpecification

- the specification defines
    - the initial OpenGLstate
    - what each function does to change or retrieve it
    - what happens when you call a rendering function
- The most important thing to understand about the specification is it describes **results**, **not implementation**

---

##The ARB

-  The specification is written by the OpenGL **Architectural Review Board** (ARB)
    - a group of representatives from companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and AMD (the ATI part), among others
    - The ARB is part of the **Khronos Group**
    - [https://www.opengl.org/archives/about/arb/](https://www.opengl.org/archives/about/arb/)

##The OpenGL Specification

- The OpenGL ARB controls the **specification**, but it does not control OpenGL's code
- It is up to the developers of that hardware to write an OpenGL **Implementation** for that hardware

---

##Who controls / builds the implementations

- Who controls the OpenGL implementation is different for different operating systems:
    - on **Windows**, OpenGL implementations are controlled virtually entirely by the hardware makers themselves
    - on **Mac OSX**, OpenGL implementations are controlled by Apple
    - ON **linux**, you have:
        - closed-source hardware controlled implementations
        - open-source hardware directed implementations
        - open source implementations
        - ...
- The upshot of this is if you are writing a program and it seems to be exhibiting off-spec behaviour, the fault is with the maker of your OpenGL implementation

---

##And finally, just for fun...

- There are many versions of the OpenGL Specification
    - [https://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/](https://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/)
- OpenGL versions are not like most Direct3D versions, which typically change most of the API
- Code that works on one version of OpenGL will almost always work on later versions of OpenGL
    - i.e. the hardware usually supports older versions
    - though not neccasraily efficiently

##GL vs GLSL version numbering

> GLSL versions have evolved alongside specific versions of the OpenGL API.
> It is only with OpenGL versions 3.3 and above that the GLSL and OpenGL major and minor version numbers match.
> These versions for GLSL and OpenGL are related in the following table.
