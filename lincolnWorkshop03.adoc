* Activities are mainly the same as Workshop 02
* but you'll be doing the *transformations* in *GLSL*
** so they'll run on the GPU, rather than the CPU
** which makes debugging a challenge

Activities
----------

[[activities-1]]
Activities
~~~~~~~~~~

* You should try to *all of these* today. Work on them in your
free-study time if you need
* You should mainly only change the GLSL shaders to do this!
** You *should not* alter the vertices in the C/C++ program.
** Only alter the vertices with GLSL
* You may find the GLSL reference card useful
** http://www.khronos.org/files/opengl-quick-reference-card.pdf
** GLSL 3.2 and 3.3 are close-enough for us
* If you want to make each of these activities as a separate
`git branch` you can
** if you fork my repo on github, and upload your own branches
** then you can send pull requests - for feedback and as *student as
producer*

[[glsl-sources]]
GLSL sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* There are *lots* of GLSL examples online
* These are a *great* place to start
* There are also examples on arcsynthesis and in the OpenGLSuperBible

[[activity-list]]
Activity List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  GLSL is *NOT* C. What are the key differences?
2.  make the triangle color something different
3.  make the triangle appear somewhere else on the screen, but the
original shape
4.  make the triangle larger than the original
5.  make the position of the triangle controlled by a *variable* that
you pass in from C/C++
* look *uniform* and *varying*
6.  make the position change over time, by changing that *variable* in
C/C++

[[stretch-activities]]
Stretch Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you've got through the standard activities then have a bash at
these

1.  make the triangle be in a rotated position
* this is *rotation*
2.  make the triangle rotate over time
3.  make the triangle translate *and* scale, over time
4.  make the triangle translate *and* rotate, over time!!!!!!!!!!
