== Apitrace - Generate Buffers

=== glGenBuffers

* https://github.com/shearer12345/graphics_examples_in_git_branches/blob/glTraingleWhiteWithApiTrace/main.cpp#L243[main.cpp
line 243 in our cpp code]

[source, cpp]

----
glGenBuffers(1, &positionBufferObject);

----

* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glGenBuffers.xhtml[glGenBuffers]
generate buffer object names
* returns n buffer object names in buffers
* in this case only 1 name is asked for, and return, the ID of buffer
object is *1*

[[glgenbuffers---context]]
glGenBuffers - context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* new buffer objects (in this case just 1) are created
* the buffer object is empty
* the *ID/name* for the buffer object is stored in the address passed in
* nothing else has changed

=== glBindBuffer

* https://github.com/shearer12345/graphics_examples_in_git_branches/blob/glTraingleWhiteWithApiTrace/main.cpp#L245[main.cpp

[source,cpp]
----
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferObject);
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glBindBuffer.xhtml[glBindBuffer]
binds a buffer object to the specified buffer binding point
* in this case the buffer object is ID=**1** (our positionBufferObject)
is bound as the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
** you can see this change in the OpenGL state (parameters tab)

=== glBindBuffer - context

* the *GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING* is now set to *1*
* nothing else has changed

=== glBufferData

----
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertexPositions), vertexPositions, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glBufferData.xhtml[glBufferData]
creates and initializes a buffer object's data store.
* Takes 4 parameters:
** target
** size
** data
** usage
* Note the *Vertex Data* tab that now shows in ApiTrace
** It is the *glBufferData* call that *copies* our CPU data to OpenGL
** This data is now visible in the debugger
*** Note: it is just 48 bytes, we can choose how to interpret it
** These are detailed more in the next section

=== glBufferData (parameters)

* GLenum target
** Specifies the target to which the buffer object is bound.
** In this case = **GL_ARRAY_BUFFER**, which is used to store vertex
attributes
* GLsizeiptr size
** the size in *bytes* of the buffer object's new data store.
** in this case *48* bytes (our array has **12 elements**, each of which
are **GL_FLOAT**s (each **32-bits **of precision == **4 bytes**)
**12*4=48**
* const GLvoid * data
** a pointer to data that will be *copied* into the data store for
initialization, or NULL if no data is to be copied.
** in this case, a pointer to the *vertexPositions* array
* GLenum usage
** the expected usage pattern of the data store
** in this case, *GL_STATIC_DRAW*
*** STATIC means *data store contents will be modified once and used
many times.*
*** DRAW means *data store contents are modified by the application, and
used as the source for GL drawing and image specification commands.*
* you can see this change in the OpenGL state (parameters tab)

=== glBufferData (byte interpretation)

* we can choose how the bytes in the buffer object are interpreted in
Vertices
* we will have to specify this when we want to use the buffer object for
rendering
* in the following example, ApiTrace is set to interpret vertices as
groups of 4 GL_FLOATS, with a 16 byte jump from one group to the next

=== glBufferData - context

* new graphics memory is allocated for the buffer
* the graphics memory is *filled* with the bytes from *vertexPositions*
* nothing else has changed
** specifically, we *have not* told OpenGL *how* to interpret the bytes

=== glBindBuffer (unbinding)

* https://github.com/shearer12345/graphics_examples_in_git_branches/blob/glTraingleWhiteWithApiTrace/main.cpp#L247[main.cpp
line 247 in our cpp code]
[source,cpp]
----
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
----
* https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glBindBuffer.xhtml[glBindBuffer]
binds a buffer object to the specified buffer binding point
* in this case the buffer object is ID=**0**
** *0* has the meaning on **no buffer**, so no buffer is any longer
bound
** you can see this change in the OpenGL state (parameters tab)
*** GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING no longer shows as it is back on its default
value

=== glBindBuffer (unbinding) - context

* the *GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING* is now set to *0* (meaning no buffer)
* nothing else has changed
