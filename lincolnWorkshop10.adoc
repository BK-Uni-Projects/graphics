Lincoln Graphics Workshop 10 - Input, Depth Buffer and Culling
--------------------------------------------------------------

[[input]]
Input
~~~~~

* so far we've had no user input to our system.
** the things that have been changing have been automatic
** usually based on time
** or requiring compile time changes
* Remember: OpenGL only supports rendering
* Input is *outside* the scope of OpenGL
* We'll use the SDL library (again)
** fairly easy to use (though low level)
** cross platform
** flexible

[[depth-buffer]]
Depth Buffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* so far each triangle rendered:
** will write on top of any previous pixels
** independent of how far away the triangle is from the screen
** the standard technique to resolve this is to use a depth-buffer

[[activities]]
Activities
----------

[[activity-1]]
Activity 1
~~~~~~~~~~

* Using Event-based input, from SDL
* Make your program dump each event to the console
** you could *just* focus on key-events
** or output for all event types

[[activity-2]]
Activity 2
~~~~~~~~~~

* When the `ESCAPE` key is pressed
** make your program exit (cleanly)

[[activity-3]]
Activity 3
~~~~~~~~~~

* When the `C` key is pressed
** make your background colour change (as a one shot event)

[[activity-3-1]]
Activity 3
~~~~~~~~~~

* When the `C` key is pressed
** toggle the background colour
** each press should switch between two colours

[[activity-4]]
Activity 4
~~~~~~~~~~

* When the `UP` key is pressed
** make your object move upwards
** it should stop moving upwards when the key is released

[[activity-5]]
Activity 5
~~~~~~~~~~

* When the `DOWN` key is pressed
** make your object move downwards
** it should stop moving downwards when the key is released

[[activity-5-1]]
Activity 5
~~~~~~~~~~

* When the `UP` or `DOWN` key is pressed
** make your object move up or down, appropriately
** when both keys are pressed the object should stop moving
** when both keys are not pressed the object should stop moving

[[acvitity-6]]
Acvitity 6
~~~~~~~~~~

* Add controls for moving your object left and right

[[activity-7]]
Activity 7
~~~~~~~~~~

* Using a Solid 3D shape (e.g. a cube)
** with different colours for each face (or textures)
* Make your program do Depth-testing
* Remember: to clear the depth buffer at the appropriate time(s)

[[activity-8]]
Activity 8
~~~~~~~~~~

* add a keyboard input to control whether depth testing is
enabled/disabled
** this should make it easy to see the effect it has

[[activity-9]]
Activity 9
~~~~~~~~~~

* Make your program do back-face-culling
** make sure you set which is the `front-face` appropriately

[[activity-10]]
Activity 10
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a keyboard input to enable/disable back-face-culling
** try all 4 combinations of depth-testing on/off and culling on/off, to
check everything is working correctly
** Remember: Depth-testing is to make the correct pixels write (be
visible)
** Remember: Culling is just an optimization
*** so, with depth-testing enabled it shouldn't have any visible effect

[[stretch-activities]]
Stretch Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*If you've got through the standard activities then have a bash at
these*

1.  Add another object and add keyboard controls for it
2.  Add another object and also add keyboard control for it
3.  Add 12 (or so) objects and add keyboard control for all of them ...
4.  Make one object render without depth testing, but another render
with depth testing
5.  Look up mouse input in SDL
(https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_MouseMotionEvent) and control the position
of an object with the mouse
6.  Control the position of the "camera" with the mouse
